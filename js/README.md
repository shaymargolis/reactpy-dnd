# reactpy_dnd

Creating react dnd objects from ReactPy

# Package Installation

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed:

```bash
npm install --save reactpy_dnd
```

For a developer installation, `cd` into this directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install required dependencies and generate a Javascript bundle that is saved
to `reactpy_dnd/bundle.js`` and is distributed with the
associated Python package.
